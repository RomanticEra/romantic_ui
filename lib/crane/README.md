instead of using `adaptive_breakpoints: ^0.1.0`, with 
```dart
bool isDisplayDesktop(BuildContext context) =>
    getWindowType(context) >= AdaptiveWindowType.medium;
```

I perfer like this:
`https://github.com/material-components/material-components-flutter-adaptive`
adaptive_components: ^0.0.3
```dart

```
